# Let's JavaScript
## Objects and Prototypes
### June 18, 2015 at AppNexus

I recently gave a talk of sorts to some of our engineering interns and fellow AppNexians who were relatively new at working with JavaScript about how objects and prototypes work. I unfortunately wasn't able to get as far into prototypes and JavaScript's "inheritance" system as I planned to, but I'll cover that in the subsequent session.

I created this HTML presentation with [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) as an overview/recap of the session for interested parties.
